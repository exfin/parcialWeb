# Care Cortada's Business Webpage

## Project Overview

This project, developed by **Mateus Lanzoni** and **Juan Miguel Lopez**, is a functional webpage built using **React** on the frontend and **NestJS** on the backend. The webpage is designed for a fictional character, **Care Cortada**, and showcases and manages various business activities. These include selling makeup, fashion drugs, and other non-legal businesses, as well as managing models and their makeup portfolios.

## Features

- **Models Management**: The webpage provides functionalities to manage various models working under Care Cortada, tracking their portfolios and business activities.
- **Makeup Portfolio**: Each model's makeup routine and brands are showcased on the page, enabling customers to browse and purchase the same products.
- **Fictional Business Operations**: In addition to legal makeup sales, the website humorously includes the sale of fictional "fashion drugs" and other non-legal business activities, all tied to Care Cortada's empire.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The site is easy to navigate, ensuring a smooth experience for users interested in both legal and fictional products.
